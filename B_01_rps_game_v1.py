**** Instructions ****

To begin, choose the number of rounds (or press <enter> for
infinite mode).

Then play against the computer. You need to choose R (rock),
P (paper) or S (scissors).

The rules are as follows:
o   Paper beats rock
o   Rock beats scissors
o   Scissors beats paper

Press <xxx> to end the game at anytime.

Good luck!
